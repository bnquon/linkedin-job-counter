# Jobscura

- ‘Obscura,’ famously used in camera obscura meaning ‘dark chamber,’ refers to an early device that projected hidden images with light.
- Jobscura is a Chrome extension that enhances LinkedIn job postings by showing additional insights such as job views, applications, and expiration dates. It helps users track and analyze job postings more effectively while browsing LinkedIn.

## Features

- Shows job expiration information in a clear, easy-to-read format.

- Uses injected scripts to intercept network requests and URL changes while keeping Chrome API calls and DOM manipulation safe in a content script.
